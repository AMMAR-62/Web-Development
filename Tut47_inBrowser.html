<!-- 
our main focus in this tutorial is to understand JavaScript. 
We have two options to place the JavaScript in the code. One is in the <head> section and the other is after the <body> tag. But if we view other professional websites, they place their JavaScript at the end of the <body> tag so that the DOM does not get affected. The basic code of JavaScript is as follows-
<script>
        //Write your js here
        console.log('Hello world');
</script>
Console is the only place, where you will find all the errors made in the code. If you have locked any request or have applied AJAX in the code, the errors regarding all these things will be shown in the console tab itself. Also, we can see the values of different variables if written in the code. 
To learn more about JavaScript stay with the tutorials.
